# CV-Maker
This project was part of the Odin Project curriculum.


## Description
The goal was to dive into React and practise using it by building an app where users can build their own CV using apps components.   

User can add their name, job title and contact information and describe their tallents and life goals. They can also add as many education and work history sections as they want. 
After CV is filled, user can choose color theme and save the product in PDF file to their machine.
